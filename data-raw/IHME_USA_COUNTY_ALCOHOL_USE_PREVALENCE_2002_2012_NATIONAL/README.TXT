United States Alcohol Use Prevalence by County 2002-2012

IHME research produced alcohol use prevalence estimates (including estimates for any drinking, heavy drinking, and binge drinking) by county, year, and sex for 2002-2012. The data also include annualized rates of change by county. The estimates were produced by applying small area models to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Study results were published in the American Journal of Public Health in April 2015 in "Drinking patterns in US counties from 2002 to 2012."

The files provided in this record contains estimates for all states and counties and the US as a whole, along with data on the 10 counties with the highest and lowest rates of any, heavy, and binge drinking by sex. Data files for each individual state and the District of Columbia are available at http://www.healthdata.org/us-health/data-download.
